# ProjectTaps

Project Taps is a game with hundreds of fast-paced, intuitive mini games.
It was inspired from Wario Ware Touched

The platform will be on touch-based phones. Android and IOS

In order to make the game successful we need to keep updating the game with new content and motivation to play.

In order to make it competitive, player can compete with other friends.
The high score will reset every 3 days.
Making them play with other friends is the best way to be successful in mobile games
Players get rewarded if they are top ranked among their friends.
However, it will be hard to get to top with many friends and some people will not add their friends to get to the top. (and that we do not want)
We need to think of some mechanism that prevents that. Like comparing global scores or rewarding players more if they have more friends.

After each match, players can challenge (one or multiple?) players and if they comply, both of them will get rewarded.

Playing the same mini game over and over is boring. We need to keep updating the game as it goes. We can start with 30+ mini games and keep adding 1-2 mini games every week, making players refreshed. 
We might be able to let players choose which mini games that they want to play versus some other player. Like multiplayer or bluetooth connection with their friends.

And what makes all of this worth it for players? Cosmetics, Collectibles. (See overwatch?)
Each of these challenges and plays will reward players with coins.
Coins will let players buy stuff in game.
